# /gstack-upgrade

Upgrade gstack to the latest version and show what's new.

## Inline upgrade flow

This section is referenced by all skill preambles when they detect `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE`.

### Step 1: Ask the user

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "gstack **v{new}** is available (you're on v{old}). Upgrade now? Takes ~10 seconds."
- Options: ["Yes, upgrade now", "Later (ask again tomorrow)"]

**If "Later":** Run `touch ~/.gstack/last-update-check` to reset the 24h timer and continue with the current skill. Do not mention the upgrade again.

### Step 2: Detect install type

```bash
if [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="global-git"
  INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d ".claude/skills/gstack/.git" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="local-git"
  INSTALL_DIR=".claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d ".claude/skills/gstack" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="vendored"
  INSTALL_DIR=".claude/skills/gstack"
elif [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack" ]; then
  INSTALL_TYPE="vendored-global"
  INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
else
  echo "ERROR: gstack not found"
  exit 1
fi
echo "Install type: $INSTALL_TYPE at $INSTALL_DIR"
```

### Step 3: Save old version

```bash
OLD_VERSION=$(cat "$INSTALL_DIR/VERSION" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
```

### Step 4: Upgrade

**For git installs** (global-git, local-git):
```bash
cd "$INSTALL_DIR"
STASH_OUTPUT=$(git stash 2>&1)
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
./setup
```
If `$STASH_OUTPUT` contains "Saved working directory", warn the user: "Note: local changes were stashed. Run `git stash pop` in the skill directory to restore them."

**For vendored installs** (vendored, vendored-global):
```bash
PARENT=$(dirname "$INSTALL_DIR")
TMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/garrytan/gstack.git "$TMP_DIR/gstack"
mv "$INSTALL_DIR" "$INSTALL_DIR.bak"
mv "$TMP_DIR/gstack" "$INSTALL_DIR"
cd "$INSTALL_DIR" && ./setup
rm -rf "$INSTALL_DIR.bak" "$TMP_DIR"
```

### Step 5: Write marker + clear cache

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.gstack
echo "$OLD_VERSION" > ~/.gstack/just-upgraded-from
rm -f ~/.gstack/last-update-check
```

### Step 6: Show What's New

Read `$INSTALL_DIR/CHANGELOG.md`. Find all version entries between the old version and the new version. Summarize as 5-7 bullets grouped by theme. Don't overwhelm — focus on user-facing changes. Skip internal refactors unless they're significant.

Format:
```
gstack v{new} — upgraded from v{old}!

What's new:
- [bullet 1]
- [bullet 2]
- ...

Happy shipping!
```

### Step 7: Continue

After showing What's New, continue with whatever skill the user originally invoked. The upgrade is done — no further action needed.

## Standalone usage

When invoked directly as `/gstack-upgrade` (not from a preamble), follow Steps 2-6 above. If already on the latest version, tell the user: "You're already on the latest version (v{version})."
